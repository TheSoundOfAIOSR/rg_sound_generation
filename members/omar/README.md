## Mapping Network

### LSTM, GRU network
Maps note_number, velocity, instrument_source, qualities, z to f0_scaled and ld_scaled
 -  Mean_squared_error on test set: 0.0269
 - Tensorboard : [Mapping networks](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/BA5eBbr1RCGqcgpjtqd0jg/)

### Mapping network using Temporal Convolutional Network

 - MSE error on test set:0.0186 
 - Tensorboard: [TCN] (https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/N7lWbOeGSW6QF6jQIzdXwg/#scalars)
 
For mapping from note_number, velocity, instrument_source, qualities, z to f0_variance and ld_scaled:[Tensorboard](https://tensorboard.dev/experiment/bSRGcVSkR1Ktk3qgMgfyIQ/#scalars)
